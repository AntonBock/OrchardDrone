Download both octomap_mapping, and octomap_server from github

catkin_make

navigate to octomap_mapping/octomap_server/launch

open octomap_mapping.launch in editor

Make sure frame_id and cloud_in are set correctly. Our standard should be "world" and "/camera/depth/points":

<param name="frame_id" type="string" value="world" />
<remap from="cloud_in" to="/camera/depth/points" />

You might want to edit the resolution as well.

Now launch simulation+RViz.
In second window, launch octomapping: roslaunch octomap_server octomap_mapping.launch

When done mapping, save octomap by writing rosrun octomap_server octomap_saver -f NameOfOctomap.bt

Saving can (maybe?) be done after stopping the mapping process in the terminal


When loading in RViz, you may need to restart RViz. use MarkerArray and occupied_cells_vis_array

When making the load_octomap.py, give executable permission
